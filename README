pTODO is a command line todo manager, written in Ruby, which hooks into the
remind calender tool. Unlike other textual todo managers it works from a
straight text file - with an easy format for tags and dates.

ptodo has nice colour support for VIM and does colour output in the console.

Run './bin/ptodo --help' to see all options.
