At this point ptodo runs fine using dd/mm(/yyyy)? dates on a light background
terminal (otherwise use the --no-color switch) and with one input file. The
following needs to be improved:

- Localise dates (allow both mm/dd and dd/mm) in ~/.ptodo
- Allow for colour selection in ~/.ptodo
- Use multiple input files in ~/.ptodo

Fixed in v0.11:

- Put untagged items in soon tag (when they have a date)
- Format dates as dd/mm
